More information
SCP-939 uses a mechanic where the last few seconds of your voice chat transmission is temporarily recorded. This can be played back by SCP-939 to lure out targets.\nThe recordings are automatically discarded if you leave the server, if SCP-939 dies, or upon round restart. Turning this feature off will remove all existing recordings of your transmissions.
